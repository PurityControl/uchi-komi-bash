#+TITLE: Notes for Smallest Multiple

used bc script this time called from bash

** Retrospective

great improvement of speed on pure bash implementation.
Now running at ~ 2.5mins but still slower than programming languages.

Nice way to delegate maths intensive processes in bash.

variables in for loops are global in bc so be careful not to use
the same variable in different loops (even in different functions).
