#+TITLE: Notes for Smallest Multiple

just use loops, bash math and modulo

** Retrospective

very slow (unuseable ~30 min) using bash math, but helpful to exercise skills
of how to do bash math, assignment etc.

would be interesting to see how fast a second iteration would be if
maths part was handed off to bc
