#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of Largest Prime Factor

Using bash utilities to see how many different ways this can
be solved rather than trying to turn bash into a generic
language lke ruby or python.

** points to note

- factor lists out the prime factors of the number you want
  to factor
- factor outputs the number to factor and a colon before it
  gives a space delimited list of factors
- cut splits on the colon delimeter and removes the number
  to factor from the results
- tr converts spaces into new lines so we have a solution
  consisting of one number per line
- sort reverse sorts (-r) so bigger numbers are at the top
  and uses a numeric sort criteria (-g) instead of a dictionary
  sort and removes unique (-u) values
- sed use 1p to print out only the first line of the result
  which is the answer

** Retrospective

Love the way that this turned out and the use of bash utilities
like sort and cut that allowed us to hone in on a result once
we had the list of factors
