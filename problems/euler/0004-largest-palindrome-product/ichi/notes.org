#+TITLE: Notes for Largest Palindrome Product

Initial idea was to pipe string of product through to rev command
and compare the two.

** Retrospective

Couldn't pipe result to external command as the spawning of a new
process for every iteration made the solution unworkable from a
performance standpoint.

Had to modify solution to do the reverse calculation within bash
to get satisfactory speed ~30 seconds to get the result.
This contrasts to ~ 160ms in ruby.

Caught out by global variables declared in iteration (for loops)
using $i twice in two separate for loops created an inifinite loop.

Would like to see a version of this implemented using a standard
unix tool such as bc and/or awk to see how it performed.
