#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of multiples

1st solution very simply inefficient solution to calculate answer and get
familiar with bash math

** Points to note

- bash arithmetic is carried out using $(( ))
- -o in a test allows us to or
- there must be a space between the brackets and the test
- seq seems to be linux specific (not on bsd's so the script is not portable)
