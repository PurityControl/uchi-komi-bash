#+TITLE: Notes for first iteration of multiples

Trying to use bash primitives to solve the problem.

** Points to note

- bash arithmetic is carried out using $(( ))
- bash arrays are set using ()
  - array=()
  - array+=($val)
- bash arrays are accessed using ${array[1]}
  - the whole array can be accessed using ${array[@]}jj
- there must be a space between the brackets and the test
- assignment doesn't like spaces
